#Math Game
This is a simple math game made in C#. The goal of the project is to showcase the language's base concepts.
The game has four game modes:


1. Addition.
2. Subtraction.
3. Multiplication.
4. Division.


You have three lives on each game mode. 1 life is subtracted if you make a wrong answer.
After all your lives are spent, the game ends and shows you your score.
You can also view your game history via the main menu.
